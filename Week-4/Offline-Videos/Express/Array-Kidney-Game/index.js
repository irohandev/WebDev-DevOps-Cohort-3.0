Question : Your logic is like a doctor
Learn by doing, lets create an in memory hospital

You need to create 4 routes (4 things that the hospital can do)

GET - User can check how many kidneys they have and their health
POST - User can add a new kidney
PUT - User can replace a kidney, make it healthy
DELETE - User can remove a kidney

What should happen if they try to delete when there are no kidneys?
What should happen if they try to make a kidney healthy when all are already healthy?
